# Project 1: Lexical Analysis

The goal of lexical analysis is to divide the input
up into "words". Another piece of code, a parser,
will be responsible for turning those words into
a language (a grammar).

There are two parts of this assignment.

- Implement a DFA in C#
- Implement that same DFA in "antlr"

## Part I: DFA in C++

You need to modify the files `dfa.cpp` and `dfa.h`.

The class `StateMachine` is incomplete. Specifically,
the `reset()` and `next()` member functions are not
implemented. `reset()` acts something like a constructor:
it should prepare a `StateMachine` object to be reused
(reinitialize it to its starting state... whatever
that means for you).

`next()` is where the action truly happens. You're
given a `StringStack` object. You can fetch one character
at a time from the StringStack and assemble the next
token. `next()` should return a value from `tokens.h`
representing the type of the current match and set the
`lexeme` variable to the text that matched the pattern.

If you read too many characters, you can use the `unget()`
member function of `StringStack` to return the current
character to the stack.

Your DFA should match the following patterns:

- C++ identifiers (`TokIdentifier`)
- Non-negative Integers (`TokInteger`)
- whitespace (space, newline, tab, carriage return) (`TokWhitespace`)
- end-of-input (`TokEOF`)
- anything else (`TokError`)

`next()` will be called over and over again until
it returns `TokEOF`.

## Part II: `flex` implementation

Writing DFA's by hand is fun, right? If you don't agree,
that's fine, and luckily there's a tool called `flex`
which will generate lexical analyzers.

I've helpfully provided a skeleton (`lex.l`) which you
can modify. You should only modify the code between the `%%`
markers because the test code depends on the code above and
below that.

Here you need to provide the regular expressions and
C++ code to run when each one is matched. The format
of that part of the file is:

```
RegularExpression1   { C++ code1(); }

RegularExpression2   { C++ code2(); }
```

`flex` helpfully creates a variable called `yytext`
that contains the lexeme, so there's really nothing
for you to do except return statements.

## Testing

The project has built-in tests. In CLion you can set
the target to a specific test OR "All CTest" to run all
the tests. You know you are done when all of the tests
pass.

- `test_stringstack`: if these tests fail, let me know
- `test_dfa`: tests of your DFA
- `test_lexer`: tests of your `flex` code

## Building

I've had good luck building this assignment in CLion
Visual Studio Code (with the Visual Studio toolchain),
and emacs (under Linux).

Visual Studio gives me an error I haven't figure out:

`/implib missing argument`

From the command line with a Windows Visual Studio
command prompt, you can build and test like this:

From the Linux (and probably mac) command line:

## What to turn in

You need to turn in exactly 3 files:

- `dfa.cpp`: your DFA implementation
- `dfa.h`: your DFA declarations
- `lex.l`: your `flex` implementation of the lexical analyzer
